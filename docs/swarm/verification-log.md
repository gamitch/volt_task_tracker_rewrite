## T001 - Vite + TS(strict) + ESLint/Prettier scaffold
Date: 2026-07-16
Result: PASS
Checker: checker-tests (2nd run, on merits — 1st run's BLOCKER verdict vacated by boss-arbiter per D001, git-bundling evidence trap)
Evidence:
- npm install/typecheck/build/lint/format:check all exit 0; dev server boots clean
- tsconfig strict:true confirmed
- zero Tailwind/shadcn confirmed via grep on package.json + package-lock.json
- index.html + package-lock.json verified as reasonable (D001-approved scope exceptions, not re-litigated)
- file tree = Allowed Files + approved exceptions only
Follow-up:
- None

## T002 - Astryx install + `volt.ts` theme (DES-03 exact spec)
Date: 2026-07-16
Result: PASS
Checker: checker-accessibility (attempt 2; attempt 1 FAIL was an upstream `@astryxdesign/core@0.1.6` type-gap issue, not a worker error)
Evidence:
- `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` both exit 0
- `src/theme/astryx-augment.d.ts` confirmed to contain only the `url?: string` addition to `TypographyRole`
- `export{}` fix empirically verified via negative-control test: checker temporarily removed `export{}`, reproduced a real TS2305 break on `defineTheme` resolution project-wide, restored it, reconfirmed clean
- `volt.ts` re-diffed byte-for-byte identical to DES-03
- no forbidden-file violations
- astryx script and CLI cross-check confirmed
- WCAG AA contrast passes both light/dark modes (carried over from attempt 1, unchanged)
Attempts: 1 (single legitimate FAIL, attempt 1; PASS on attempt 2)
Follow-up:
- NIT (log only, not a new task): consider filing an upstream issue against `@astryxdesign/core@0.1.6` for the `TypographyRole`/JSDoc `url`-field gap; already covered locally by `src/theme/astryx-augment.d.ts`.

## T009 - Migration: identity/roster tables
Date: 2026-07-16
Result: PASS (MINOR finding, non-blocking)
Checker: checker-tests (attempt 1)
Evidence:
- Column-by-column diff of all 5 tables (profiles, teams, seasons, students, guardian_links) against PRD 8.1 ground truth: zero deltas
- id/created_at conventions and FK `on delete restrict` conventions confirmed table by table
- `seasons` partial unique index on `(is_active) where is_active = true` verified correct via static SQL review (no live Postgres instance available)
- Confirmed no RLS/policy statements present (correctly out of scope — T012's job)
- `supabase/migrations/` directory listing confirmed exactly one file exists (constitution item 10)
- `role_enum` type placement judged reasonable for this migration; forward note logged for future migrations to reuse, not redefine, the type
Findings:
- MINOR: `profiles.avatar_url text not null` with no default. Worker applied a consistent "no null-marker in PRD 8.1 = NOT NULL" rule, but PRD SET-01 describes avatar upload as a post-creation settings action, so this column would block INSERT into `profiles` until an avatar URL is supplied. Judged a genuine PRD 8.1 ambiguity, not a worker error. Non-blocking for T009.
Follow-up:
- Routed as an amendment to T019's existing acceptance criteria (task-ledger.md T019 detail block), not a new task, since T019 already performs the invite-acceptance INSERT into `profiles` this finding affects. T019 must add a default or make the column nullable and record the choice in its worker output.
