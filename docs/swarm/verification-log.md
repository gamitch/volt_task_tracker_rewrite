## T001 - Vite + TS(strict) + ESLint/Prettier scaffold
Date: 2026-07-16
Result: PASS
Checker: checker-tests (2nd run, on merits — 1st run's BLOCKER verdict vacated by boss-arbiter per D001, git-bundling evidence trap)
Evidence:
- npm install/typecheck/build/lint/format:check all exit 0; dev server boots clean
- tsconfig strict:true confirmed
- zero Tailwind/shadcn confirmed via grep on package.json + package-lock.json
- index.html + package-lock.json verified as reasonable (D001-approved scope exceptions, not re-litigated)
- file tree = Allowed Files + approved exceptions only
Follow-up:
- None

## T002 - Astryx install + `volt.ts` theme (DES-03 exact spec)
Date: 2026-07-16
Result: PASS
Checker: checker-accessibility (attempt 2; attempt 1 FAIL was an upstream `@astryxdesign/core@0.1.6` type-gap issue, not a worker error)
Evidence:
- `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` both exit 0
- `src/theme/astryx-augment.d.ts` confirmed to contain only the `url?: string` addition to `TypographyRole`
- `export{}` fix empirically verified via negative-control test: checker temporarily removed `export{}`, reproduced a real TS2305 break on `defineTheme` resolution project-wide, restored it, reconfirmed clean
- `volt.ts` re-diffed byte-for-byte identical to DES-03
- no forbidden-file violations
- astryx script and CLI cross-check confirmed
- WCAG AA contrast passes both light/dark modes (carried over from attempt 1, unchanged)
Attempts: 1 (single legitimate FAIL, attempt 1; PASS on attempt 2)
Follow-up:
- NIT (log only, not a new task): consider filing an upstream issue against `@astryxdesign/core@0.1.6` for the `TypographyRole`/JSDoc `url`-field gap; already covered locally by `src/theme/astryx-augment.d.ts`.

## T009 - Migration: identity/roster tables
Date: 2026-07-16
Result: PASS (MINOR finding, non-blocking)
Checker: checker-tests (attempt 1)
Evidence:
- Column-by-column diff of all 5 tables (profiles, teams, seasons, students, guardian_links) against PRD 8.1 ground truth: zero deltas
- id/created_at conventions and FK `on delete restrict` conventions confirmed table by table
- `seasons` partial unique index on `(is_active) where is_active = true` verified correct via static SQL review (no live Postgres instance available)
- Confirmed no RLS/policy statements present (correctly out of scope — T012's job)
- `supabase/migrations/` directory listing confirmed exactly one file exists (constitution item 10)
- `role_enum` type placement judged reasonable for this migration; forward note logged for future migrations to reuse, not redefine, the type
Findings:
- MINOR: `profiles.avatar_url text not null` with no default. Worker applied a consistent "no null-marker in PRD 8.1 = NOT NULL" rule, but PRD SET-01 describes avatar upload as a post-creation settings action, so this column would block INSERT into `profiles` until an avatar URL is supplied. Judged a genuine PRD 8.1 ambiguity, not a worker error. Non-blocking for T009.
Follow-up:
- Routed as an amendment to T019's existing acceptance criteria (task-ledger.md T019 detail block), not a new task, since T019 already performs the invite-acceptance INSERT into `profiles` this finding affects. T019 must add a default or make the column nullable and record the choice in its worker output.

## T002a - React 18→19 upgrade (D002 corrective task)
Date: 2026-07-16
Result: PASS
Checker: checker-tests (attempt 2, on merits; attempt 1 FAIL was a legitimate but narrow pre-existing gap, not a worker fault)
Evidence:
- Attempt 1 (FAIL/MAJOR): React 19 upgrade itself fully sound — clean install with no `--legacy-peer-deps`, `npm ls react react-dom @astryxdesign/core` clean, `node -e` confirmed `react.use()` is a function, build/typecheck/lint exit 0, mandatory runtime smoke test (vitest+jsdom, real `createRoot`/`act` render of `<Theme><App/></Theme>`, asserts h1 text) passes. Sole gap: `npm run format:check` exited 1 on `src/theme/volt.ts` — checker traced this via `git show` to a pre-existing Prettier `bracketSpacing` drift predating T002a (inherited from T002's verbatim DES-03 block), not introduced by this task. Checker-approved fix: narrow the `format`/`format:check` glob in `package.json` to exclude `src/theme/volt.ts`; `volt.ts` content itself must never be edited.
- Attempt 2 (PASS): worker applied a `package.json` glob negation (`"!src/theme/volt.ts"`) scoping the exclusion to exactly one file. Checker independently re-ran everything rather than trusting worker claims: `npm run format:check` exits 0; `react`/`react-dom` confirmed at 19.2.7 via re-run of `npm ls` (clean, no ELSPROBLEMS); `react.use()` re-confirmed a function; build/typecheck/lint/vitest all exit 0, including the mandatory runtime smoke test still passing; `volt.ts` re-diffed byte-for-byte identical to the DES-03 block (not just "git diff empty"); `astryx-augment.d.ts` unchanged from T002's approved content; glob negation independently verified not over-broad via the checker's own injected-formatting-violation test on a different file (`astryx-augment.d.ts`, subsequently fully reverted and reconfirmed clean) plus direct reading of the glob syntax; no forbidden-file violations (`docs/swarm/**`, `.claude/**` untouched; `volt.ts` content untouched).
Attempts: 1 (single legitimate FAIL, attempt 1; PASS on attempt 2)
Follow-up:
- None. D002's React 18→19 stack-lock reversal is now fully closed out end-to-end. T003 unblocked (Blocked→Ready) as a direct result — see task-ledger.md and state-summary.md.
