# GAM-407 run log

Issue: [GAM-407](https://linear.app/gamitch/issue/GAM-407/supabase-as-the-operational-run-store-is-the-plans-least-confident)
Tier: `tier/heavy` (label `heavy`), route `executor/claude` (label `claude`), no `gate/human`.
Branch: `claude/gam-407-supabase-run-store-spike`
Runtime: Claude (Opus 5), dispatched from Linear on 2026-08-18.

Append-only. One line per milestone, pushed immediately. If the last line of this
file is a dispatch with no matching verdict, **the run died holding that subagent** —
that is the failure signature `AGENTS.md` § "Two walls" describes, not a mystery.

---

- 2026-08-18 — **Claimed.** Read `AGENTS.md` § "Where work comes from" and
  `docs/swarm/constitution.md` items 18, 19, 26, 28 before touching Linear.
  Moved GAM-407 `Todo → In Progress` via `scripts/linear/client.mjs`
  (`issueUpdate` success: true) and **read back**: state `In Progress`, labels
  `other, heavy, Improvement, claude`. Claim held, not hoped. Tier already
  `tier/heavy`, so item 28d tiering-at-claim did not apply; item 26 concurrence
  recorded below.
- 2026-08-18 — **Run log created and pushed as the first file write** (this file).
